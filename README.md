3. Use like a native app!

## 🛠️ Built With

- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling (100% utility-first approach)
- Service Worker for PWA functionality
- LocalStorage for data persistence

## 🎨 Styling Architecture

This project uses a **pure Tailwind CSS approach** with no custom CSS overrides for utility classes. All spacing, colors, typography, and layout are handled through Tailwind utility classes. Custom CSS is reserved only for:

- Complex animations and transitions
- CSS custom properties (CSS variables)
- Component-specific styling that cannot be expressed with utilities
- Dynamic gradients and complex visual effects

### CSS Migration Status ✅

- **Phase 1-10**: Completed - All convertible utility overrides migrated to Tailwind
- **Remaining CSS**: Only essential component styling and CSS variables
- **Zero `!important` rules**: All utility-level overrides eliminated
- **View visibility**: Now handled by Tailwind `hidden`/`block` classes
- **Swipe containers**: Use `overflow-visible` for proper swipe behavior
